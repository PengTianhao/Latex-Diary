\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Today it was impressed by new material design of android and many apps using its design principles,I doubt what is the need of a UI/UX designer ? All things are done by \textbf{Google}.
\textbf{i3WM}'s \textbf{i3-nagbar} is simple tool to show a dialog,and added a `s` switch for using it with logout dialog.

What is does is that when `s` is used,if already a nagbar exists then new will not popup :D 


$\sqrt{i}$ is still imaginary :D
